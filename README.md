## Phase 1
--------------------------------
Phase 1 is deciding what topic we would study


- We decided to take option 1 since we want to dive deeper into the article, and we already did something similar with option 2 in CS 105
> Note: `Option 1: Select a set of papers related to a topic that we discussed. Write a summary describing the topic and the approach detailed in the research papers. Next, select one paper and implement the proposed algorithm, solution, etc. For example, you may come across a set of papers on computing "fairness." You will first compile a survey on this topic by selecting 3+ papers related to fairness metrics then proceed to replicate the proposed approach described in 1 of the papers. `

## Project Idea (Phase 1.5)
--------------------------------
Differential Privacy <br />

>One topic we are interested in is Differential Privacy since this is a topic that generally won’t create direct profits/benefits for companies. Hence, a lot of companies might not be willing to spend their valuable resources on this, and we can only hope that they do some protection to our privacy.  <br />


Here are the goals of this research: <br />
-- To understanding how big companies treat our data to protect our privacy. <br />
-- To find what we can do as a user to better protect our own privacy. <br />
-- To educate readers if/how our data is being protected or not. <br />

## Instructions For Running Code
--------------------------------
1. Install the latest Python version on your machine if you have not done so already. You can download the latest version from the official Python website (https://www.python.org/downloads/).
2. Download the iris flower dataset from our repository. Save the file as "iris.csv" in the same directory as the main.py file.
3. Make sure you have the required dependencies installed on your computer. The libraries used in our code are matplotlib, numpy, pandas, sklearn, and scipy. You can install them using pip, the Python package installer. For example, to install numpy, you can run the command "pip install numpy" in your terminal or command prompt.
4. Use an Python-supported IDE such as Microsoft Visual Studio, Visual Studio Code, etc to run our main.py file.


## Papers/Reference (Proposal Phase)  [Updated]
--------------------------------

Krishaan Patel is currently working on the summary for the “The Bounded Laplace Mechanism In Differential Privacy” paper.<br />

Chun Ho Wong is currently working on the summary for the “Differential privacy in health research: A scoping review” paper.<br />

Edmund Wong is currently working on the summary for the “Differential privacy for public health data: An innovative tool to optimize information sharing while protecting data confidentiality” paper.<br />

After discussing with TA, we are implementing the Bounded Laplace Mechanism algorithm described in the paper https://journalprivacyconfidentiality.org/index.php/jpc/article/view/715/690.  <br />

The Dataset used in the research paper and our implementation is the Iris Flower Dataset.<br />

## Project Presentation (Phase 2)
--------------------------------
We are currently working on the presentation https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1XugUg07pRdyjtaIZ8yQ8LhkL0AKFN7gVWmr9YCH7zzI/edit?usp=sharing
After that, we would enhance and finalize the product during the weekend for the final release.
