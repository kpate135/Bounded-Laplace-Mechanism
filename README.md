## Phase 1

Phase 1 is deciding what option and topic we would be choosing

- We decided to take option 1 since we want to dive deeper into the article, and we already did something similar with option 2 in CS 105
> Note: `Option 1: Select a set of papers related to a topic that we discussed. Write a summary describing the topic and the approach detailed in the research papers. Next, select one paper and implement the proposed algorithm, solution, etc. For example, you may come across a set of papers on computing "fairness." You will first compile a survey on this topic by selecting 3+ papers related to fairness metrics then proceed to replicate the proposed approach described in 1 of the papers. `
