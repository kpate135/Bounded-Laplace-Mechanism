## Phase 1
--------------------------------
Phase 1 is deciding what topic we would study


- We decided to take option 1 since we want to dive deeper into the article, and we already did something similar with option 2 in CS 105
> Note: `Option 1: Select a set of papers related to a topic that we discussed. Write a summary describing the topic and the approach detailed in the research papers. Next, select one paper and implement the proposed algorithm, solution, etc. For example, you may come across a set of papers on computing "fairness." You will first compile a survey on this topic by selecting 3+ papers related to fairness metrics then proceed to replicate the proposed approach described in 1 of the papers. `

## Project Idea (Phase 1.5)
--------------------------------
Differential Privacy <br />

>One topic we are interested in is Differential Privacy since this is a topic that generally wonâ€™t create direct profits/benefits for companies. Hence, a lot of companies might not be willing to spend their valuable resources on this, and we can only hope that they do some protection to our privacy.  <br />


Here are the goals of this research: <br />
-- To understanding how big companies treat our data to protect our privacy. <br />
-- To find what we can do as a user to better protect our own privacy. <br />
-- To educate readers if/how our data is being protected or not. <br />

## Papers/Reference (Proposal Phase)
--------------------------------
We would be implementing the algorithm discussed in the third paper, and try to mimic the study they have done. The paper takes the algorithm and applies it to clinical data mining through tests for binomial proportions and contingency tables.
